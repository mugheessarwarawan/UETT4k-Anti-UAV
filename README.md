# UETT4k-Anti-UAV
This this link provides images used in our research of Anti UAV  in 4K. Data will be published as the research paper is published.
The core idea is to create a purpose built dataset of drone images in 4K resolution , i.e. 3840x2160.
We trained more than 12 varaints of YOLO, Yolov6v3 nano ,  Yolov6v3 small, Yolov6v3 Medium, Yolov6v3 large. 
Also we trained high resolution network supporting resolution of 1280 x1280, thus using YOLOV6v3 N6, S6,M6,L6.

total images = 33,601
with train, test and validation sets having
 26599, 4000 and 3002 images,
Samples images can be obtained by e mail me on mugheessarwarawan@yahoo.com
